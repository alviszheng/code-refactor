# Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.
